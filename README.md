# space-invaders-project
That's a school work, we would recreate the famous game 'space invaders' for the web.

## Project download
The first thing to do is download the project, for that you have to use the command `git clone` with the link of this repository, 
then the main folder of the game will be downloaded, **space-invaders-project**.

## Component Installation
To install the game dependencies you have to go under the path "**structure**" and then run the following command:
<br>`npm install`

## Compilation and execution of the code
To compile the code, the following command must be executed within the "**structure**" path:
<br>`npm run build:prod`<br>

After executing the command, a folder named "build" will be created in the root of the project path.
That folder contains an **_index.html_** file and that must be used to run the game.
